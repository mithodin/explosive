Hello. This is the source code directory of Lucas Treffenst√§dt's master thesis.

COMPILE
create build directory, cd to it and run
  cmake ..
followed by
  make
All configuration is done via config.h. Why? Because it was easier and compile time is cheap, that's why. Seriously though, it is much less of a hassle to get logging and memory right if we know the system size at compile time.

RUN
cd to the bin directory and run the simulation
  ./explosive

REQUIREMENTS
 - Intel icc compiler (should be easy to change code to work with gcc, though)
 - hdf5 c bindings (libhdf5)
