How to build:
 * Install libconfig development files (libconfig-dev package for debian)
 * Install cmake
 * Create a directory 'build' within this source directory
 * Descend into 'build' and execute 'cmake ..'
 * Then execute 'make'

You should now have an executable 'patchy_main' in the 'bin' folder.
Usage: ./patchy_main x
Where x is the number of concurrent threads to run
